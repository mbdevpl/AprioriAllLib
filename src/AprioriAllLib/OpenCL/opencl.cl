	\brief All OpenCL kernels used by parallel implementations.
	
	Source code of these kernels is embedded into AprioriAllLib.dll and is compiled at runtime 
	in order to optimize the resulting machine code to a specific environment. The word environment
	in this case should be understood as local CPU, GPU and operating system configuration.
