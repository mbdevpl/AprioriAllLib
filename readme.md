## How to use the application

Launch <code>/bin/AprioriAll/AprioriAll.bat</code> to see an example.

Launch <code>/bin/AprioriAll/AprioriAll.exe</code> with correct command line arguments 
to execute AprioriAll algorithm for an arbitrary input data. When the program is run without any options,
it displays information about available options.
