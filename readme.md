====================================

(C) 2012, Karolina Baltyn and Mateusz Bysiek

How to use the application
--------------------------

This is (for the moment) a pure test application, it does not have any interface 
allowing any user-defined input. Such feature is planned.


Where is everything
-------------------

* */AprioriAllLib* - library that implements the algorithm
* */AprioriAllTest* - unit tests, which check correctness of the implementation
* */ConsoleTestAprioriAll* - a test console app
* */SequentialMiningApriori* - another test console app
