## How to use the application

Launch <code>/bin/Release/AprioriAll.bat</code> 
or <code>/bin/Release/Apriori.bat</code>
to see an example.

Launch <code>/bin/Release/AprioriAll.exe</code> 
or <code>/bin/Release/Apriori.exe</code>
with correct command line arguments to execute AprioriAll algorithm 
for an arbitrary input data. When the program is run without any options,
it displays information about available options.

### Examples

<code>AprioriAll dataset1.xml 0.2</code> runs AprioriAll algorithm with support 0.2 on given data set

<code>Apriori dataset2.xml 0.3</code> runs Apriori algorithm with support 0.3 on given data set
